# What does your favorite workplace look like?

I have many expectations about workplace.
One of my most important expectations is to have a mentor to guide me to improve myself.
I believe that mentoring will play an important role in achieving my career goals.
However, I would like to have a powerful computer that will not negatively affect my work speed.
I would like to be happy at work and I would like to have trust and confidence in the people I work with.
Respect for my work, appreciation of my achievements and recognition of my contributions will increase my motivation in the work environment.
