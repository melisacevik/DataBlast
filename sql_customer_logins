Question 2

2.1)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CustomerLogins

2.2)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CustomerLogins
WHERE LoginDate = '2015-05-01'

2.3)
Assuming that CustomerIDs are unique, we can solve it like this:

SELECT Count(CustomerID) FROM CustomerLogin

2.4)
CREATE TABLE CustomerLogins (
    CustomerID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    LoginDate DATE,
    Platform VARCHAR(255)
);

2.5)
I can interpret it assuming we have tables A and B:
Table A has columns country_id, country_name, population.
Table B has columns country_id, country_name, location.

Inner Join: Gets the matching records of two tables. It brings the matching (intersection) records of table A and B and joins these tables.

In other words, it will join by country_id and country_name and bring other columns.

Outer Join:

a) Left Join (Left Outer Join):
Here it considers table A as the primary table and brings all records and matching table B records.
If there is no matching record in table B, it is filled with NULL values.

b) Right Join(Right Outer Join):
Retrieves all records in table B and matching table A records.
If there is no matching record in table A, it is filled with NULL values.

c) Full Outer Join:
Full outer join retrieves all records in tables A and B.
If there is no matching record in one table, the corresponding field in the other table is filled with a NULL value.
